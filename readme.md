Upload of my code and assets for my Ludum Dare 38 submission, It's A Small System. This project was made in Unity.

This game was created from scratch, when I was 16 years old, in 48 hours! The theme was "A Small World". It's rough but I'm very proud of it, as it was one of my first forays into making games.
